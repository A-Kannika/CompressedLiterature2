# Compressed Literature Program version 2
Compressed Literature Program version 2 is a project for Data Structure course | TCSS 342 | @the University of Washington Tacoma
<br/>
Compressed Literator 2 Program uses my own Hash Table Data Structure, Priority Queue, and Huffman Compression Algorithm.

## Description
This program compresses data from Leo Tolstoyâ€™s War and Peace literature consisting of over 3 million characters 
and writes it in a binary file format as the Compressed Literator Program version 1. 
But I used the hash table data structure instead of the minimum heap data structure. 
As a result, the compressed file size from this version is smaller, and the compressed time is faster than the first version.

## Getting Started
- Build the hash table data structure.
- Handle collisions in the hash table.
- Use the hash table to store over 20000 pieces of data.
- Use words as symbols in your Huffman algorithm toimprove compression.

## The result of the Compressed Literator Program version 2: 
- Compressed characters file from 3214 Kb to 1011 Kb in a binary file format with less than 1 second running time.
